# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the COVID-19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) using Python and pandas. It includes data cleaning, exploration, visualizations, and key insights related to the spread, impact, and response to COVID-19 in selected countries.

## Goals
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Generate visual insights using bar charts and heatmaps
- Summarize key findings and observations

## Tools Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Insights & Reporting

### Key Insights:
1. **India, USA, and Brazil** reported the highest total COVID-19 cases globally.
2. **The USA had the highest number of total deaths**, followed by Brazil and India.
3. **Vaccine rollout was fastest in high-income countries**, with the USA and several European nations showing early high vaccination rates.
4. **A strong positive correlation** was observed between total cases and total deaths.
5. **New waves of infections** were evident in multiple countries based on spikes in new cases.

### Anomalies & Patterns:
- Some countries reported zero or unusually low values for vaccinations, indicating possible underreporting or lack of data.
- Sudden spikes in daily new cases or deaths in specific countries may reflect data backlog or reporting anomalies.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook (`covid_analysis.ipynb`) step-by-step to:
- Clean the dataset
- Explore structure and missing values
- Visualize key metrics
- Interpret trends and anomalies
